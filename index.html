                            Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world’s economies,
                            cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, 
                            and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships to 
                            facilitate these movements over many centuries. But the term gained popularity after the Cold War 
                            in the early 1990s, as these cooperative arrangements shaped modern everyday life. This guide uses
                            the term more narrowly to refer to international trade and some of the investment flows among 
                            advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States.

                            The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major 
                            technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups.
                            Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while 
                            sustaining the wider payoffs.

                            Globalization can create new opportunities, new ideas, and open new markets that an 
                            entrepreneur may have not had in their home country. As a result, there are a number of 
                            positives associated with globalization: 
                            <blockquote>
                                1. It creates greater opportunities for firms in less industrialized countries to 
                                    tap into more and larger markets around the world <br>
                                2. This can lead to more access to capital flows, technology, human capital, cheaper 
                                    imports and larger export markets <br>
                                3. it allows businesses in less industrialized countries to become part of international 
                                    production networks and supply chains that are the main conduits of trade <br>
                            </blockquote>
                            For many developing nations, globalization has led to an improvement in standard of living through 
                            improved roads and transportation, improved health care, and improved education due to the global 
                            expansion of corporations. 
                        </p1><br><br>
                        <p2>
                            Despite its benefits, the economic growth driven by globalization has not been done without awakening 
                            criticism. The consequences of globalization are far from homogeneous: income inequalities, disproportional 
                            wealth and trades that benefit parties differently. In the end, one of the criticisms is that some actors 
                            (countries, companies, individuals) benefit more from the phenomena of globalization, while others are 
                            sometimes perceived as the “losers” of globalization. <br><br>
